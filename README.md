# Spotify Forest

This project was created for my Springboard Software Developement Career Track course, serving as my second and final Capstone Project.

The goal of Spotify Forest is to create a social network where users can easily join groups to view other user's top listened to tracks and artists. Today, using apps such as Spotify and Apple Music has made it so easy to find new music that the community aspect of sharing songs between one another has been greatly lost. Hopefully through Spotify Forest, this hugely important part of music will be restored.

The entire project cosnists of two repositories ([Frontend](https://github.com/NickOsterfelt/SpotifyForest-frontend) and [Backend](https://github.com/NickOsterfelt/SpotifyForest-backend)), this repository being the frontend.



## The Frontend
#### Major Requirements
- Node.js (with npm)
- React with Create React app
- Axios
- react-bootstrap
- react-router
- Bootstrap
- fontawesome
- (complete list is in package.json)

#### To run the app:
 - Create or ensure that you have a Spotify Account.
 - Install dependancies
 	- `npm i` (should take a long time)
 - Compile the project and start the frontend server
 	- `npm start`
 - if you have not done so, install and start the backend server
 	- (instructions found [Here](https://github.com/NickOsterfelt/SpotifyForest-backend))

### User flow:
	1. User logs in through spotify portal.
	2. User is displayed their profile in left sidebar, current groups they are a part of in the middle section, and other user profile on left side bar
	3. User can join groups based on searching by group name, groups that have matching artists, and groups that have matching tracks.
